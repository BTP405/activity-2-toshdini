<!-- Approach 1 -->
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): 
        res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')

Function doubleL(n): This function takes a parameter n and initializes an empty list res. It then iterates over the range of n, multiplying each value by 2 and appending it to the res list. Finally, it returns the list res.
Printing loop: The loop iterates over the result of calling doubleL(5) and prints each value followed by a colon.

<!-- Approach 2 -->

for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')

This approach uses a list comprehension [n * 2 for n in range(5)] to generate the sequence directly.
It iterates over each element of the list generated by the list comprehension and prints each value followed by a colon.

<!-- Approach 3 -->

def doubleG(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
    print(i, end=' : ')

Generator function doubleG(n): This function is a generator that yields the doubled values for each iteration up to n. Instead of creating a list, it yields each value as it's computed, thus saving memory.
Printing loop: The loop iterates over the values yielded by doubleG(5) and prints each value followed by a colon.

Type of function doubleG(n):

The function doubleG(n) is a generator function. It differs from regular functions as it contains one or more yield statements, which suspends the functionâ€™s state and later resumes execution, yielding a value each time. The advantage of using such a function is that it allows for lazy evaluation, meaning it generates values as needed, potentially saving memory and improving performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. Additionally, generator functions can be more readable and concise compared to their equivalent implementations using lists.
